## Grades

- Letter grades (A through F) follow a traditional, descending 10-point scale, where the top 2 points earn a + and bottom 2 points earn a - for each letter grade. There is no extra credit nor grade inflation. Final grades are calculated with the following weights:

- 40% Open Source maintenance portfolio
- 20% Lesson designed and lead
- 20% Quizzes (technical skill evaluations)
- 20% Exercises (learning activity participation and completion)
