## Professional Work Policy

- Just in life, there is no extra credit. However, there are opportunities to either make up for small mistakes or magnify them.
- By demonstrating outstanding work, every student has the opportunity to have poor grades dropped. 
Professionalism (+1) is awarded at the instructor's discretion to acknowledge work that demonstrates critical thinking and/or hard work. OWC may be awarded for excellent questions, volunteering, or otherwise going above and beyond. 
- On the other hand, (-1) are also given at the instructor's discretion to recognize when a student's behavior does not live up to expectations. For example, PM may be given for not following instructions or otherwise being irresponsible.

At the end of the semester...
- a net positive will result in that student's lowest exercise grade(s) being dropped. For example, if a Professionalism of +3 has been earned, the three lowest exercise grades will be dropped. In cases where all exercise are 100% (or already dropped), additional points will then drop the next higher assignment value
- a net negative will result in dropping the student's highest exercise grade for every extra (net) PM.
