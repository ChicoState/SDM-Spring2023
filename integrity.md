## Intellectual Integrity Policy

We highly value learning and hard work. Therefore, in accordance with department policy, this class has a strict policy for any instances of cheating, which includes plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, or otherwise misrepresenting someone else's thoughts as your own.

Software Engineering is an important and valuable skill for the 21st century and it is our responsibility that grades reflect those earned demonstrating your own understanding of the subject. Holding ourselves to any lower standard hurts the reputation of the department, school, and misrepresents a skill set that can result in real harm to society.

Any graded work should be considered an individual assignment, unless stated explicitly otherwise by the instructor. On individual assignments, students may not either give nor receive help from any other parties or resources.
When reference material is allowed on a graded assignment, students are expected to **properly cite their sources (using ACM format) and avoid plagiarism by giving credit to the original author's intellectual contributions.** When there is any question or doubt about a source or interaction is allowed, always consult the instructor first.

If you make the poor choice of breaking any of the intellectual integrity policies, the repercussions include: 
- 0 for the assignment that can not be dropped nor made up.
- Referral to Student Judicial Aairs, who decide appropriate action from the school including probation or up to expulsion
- For egregious or repeated offenses, F for the course.

Courses failed due to intellectual integrity violations cannot be re-taken for forgiveness
