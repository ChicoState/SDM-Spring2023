# Open Source maintenance portfolio

The primary activity in the class is the maintenance of open source software. To showcase your contributions, you will set up an online portfolio of your work.

Contributions in your portfolio may include:

* Production code (and tests, accepted into main via Pull Request)
* Developer Operations (integrated into main, via Pull Request)
* Code review (via Pull Request feedback and decisions)
* Bug logging and troubleshooting (via Issues)

## Getting Started

Create a repository or [set up a custom GitHub profile](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) with a `README.md` that contains two sections: **Highlights** and **Timeline**

### Highlights

This is where you will showcase what you consider your most significant contributions. Create a list of 2-4 contributions you have made during the semester and for each one, provide:

* A concise but descriptive title (e.g. "Added client management feature") that is a direct hyperlink to the contribution (e.g. Pull Request's URL, commit URL, etc.)
* A sentence or two explaining your role, with acknowledgement of who else was directly involved in that specific activity (along with what they did collectively).
* A plain-word explanation for how your contribution improves the product, as could be understood by even novice Software Engineers.

The highlights should include at least two different types of contributions (from above), and at least one of which should be a direct, technical contribution of **Production Code** or **Developer Operations**.

### Timeline

With a subsection for each sprint (i.e. `## Sprint 1`) during the semester, create a bullet-list below it that summarizes what you worked on. You can list activities that are incomplete/unresolved (e.g. work on a feature not yet submitted as a Pull Request) or dismissed (e.g. a bug logged but closed without need for resolution, or a Pull Request rejected). Provide a link in the repo to show evidence of your work when possible.
