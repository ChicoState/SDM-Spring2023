## Intellectual Integrity Policy

- We highly value learning and hard work. Therefore, in accordance with department policy, this class has a strict policy for any instances of cheating, which includes plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, or otherwise misrepresenting someone else's thoughts as your own.
- Software Engineering is an important and valuable skill for the 21st century and it is our responsibility that grades reflect those earned demonstrating your own understanding of the subject. Holding ourselves to any lower standard hurts the reputation of the department, school, and misrepresents a skill set that can result in real harm to society.
- Any graded work should be considered an individual assignment, unless stated explicitly otherwise by the instructor. On individual assignments, students may not either give nor receive help from any other parties or resources.
- When reference material is allowed on a graded assignment, students are expected to properly cite their sources (using ACM format) and avoid plagiarism by giving credit to the original author's intellectual contributions. When there is any question or doubt about a source or interaction is allowed, always consult the instructor first.
- If you make the poor choice of breaking any of the intellectual integrity policies, the repercussions include: 
    - 0 for the assignment that can not be dropped nor made up.
    - Referral to Student Judicial Aairs, who decide appropriate action from the school including probation or up to expulsion
    - For egregious or repeated offenses, F for the course.
    - Courses failed due to intellectual integrity violations cannot be re-taken for forgiveness

## Accommodations

- If you need any special accommodations, contact the instructor outside of class so arrangements can be made.

## Confidentiality and Mandatory Reporting

- As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment on our campus. I also have a mandatory reporting responsibility related to my role as a professor. I am required to share information regarding sexual misconduct with the University. Students may speak to someone confidentially by contacting the Counseling and Wellness Center (898-6345) or Safe Place (898-3030). Information on campus reporting obligations and other Title IX related resources are available here: www.csuchico.edu/title-ix

## Inclusion and Respect

- As an educator, I take it as my responsibility to make the classroom an effective learning environment. I expect everyone to be a part of a respectful environment both inside and outside of class. At Chico State, everyone should feel welcome and respected. If you have concerns, please bring them to my attention via email (kbuardi@csuchico.edu) or in an appointment in my office (OCNL 220).
I am trained as a Safe Zone Ally and Dreamer Ally. However, if you do not feel comfortable talking to me, I also recommend reaching out to the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.

## Professional Work Policy

- Just in life, there is no extra credit. However, there are opportunities to either make up for small mistakes or magnify them.
- By demonstrating outstanding work, every student has the opportunity to have poor grades dropped. 
Professionalism (+1) is awarded at the instructor's discretion to acknowledge work that demonstrates critical thinking and/or hard work. OWC may be awarded for excellent questions, volunteering, or otherwise going above and beyond. 
- On the other hand, (-1) are also given at the instructor's discretion to recognize when a student's behavior does not live up to expectations. For example, PM may be given for not following instructions or otherwise being irresponsible.

At the end of the semester...
- a net positive will result in that student's lowest exercise grade(s) being dropped. For example, if a Professionalism of +3 has been earned, the three lowest exercise grades will be dropped. In cases where all exercise are 100% (or already dropped), additional points will then drop the next higher assignment value
- a net negative will result in dropping the student's highest exercise grade for every extra (net) PM.
